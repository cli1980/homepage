I write.<p>
Most of the time I write software, for a living and for fun, and the fun part is that I get a chance to play with dozens of computer languages, giving me a sense of accomplishment when I lament how hard it has been for me to learn new languages in the real world. That's not surprising for ambitious young people who just walk out of the campus, when I was one of them I planned to learn Japanese, German, and maybe Spanish too. Unfortunately I'm yet to be able to read any original from Kafka or MÃ¡rquez, nor can I watch Manga series without caption.<p>
Occasionally I write something else, poems, essays, and even one or two pieces of fictions, mostly in Chinese, completely for fun.<p>
I paint too.<p>
Though I rarely set up the easel these days I did paint a lot when I was young, especially before I was persuaded to give up the dream of being a fashion designer and turned to the computer science instead.<p>
Computer science is good, everything has to be either true or false, nothing inexplicable.
