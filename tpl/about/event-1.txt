The town is small, rural and old, hidden among the mountains for hundreds of years, caging me to a monotonous planet where the only window to the outside world is a handful of books thrown in my parents' closet. What I had learnt in the books was that my hometown was mean, nothing and I should flee away as soon as possile.
That's it, I dont' want to conceal any true feelings when I was young and lived in the town, event though that makes me look snobbish, arrogant and petty.<p>
But it doesn't mean the time I've spent there is negligible, which is still the same time as others had in their youth: nostalgic, sunny, quiet and mostly happy.
