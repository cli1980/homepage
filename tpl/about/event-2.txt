My first impression of the City was not great, largely due to the lack of modern buildings which in my heart should always be the symbol of urban flourish. Most of the multi-story dwellings were in Soviet style: 4 to 6 stories, dull, dreary and characterless.<p>
People there seem to be living in the past, when someone tries comparing the City to others they just suddenly rewind the time years, decades, even centries back and retort with scornï¼Œ asking where those cities were when their king lighted the beacons in the Great Wall. Then it is understandable for a rural boy who has never been to a city to be obsessed in the ethereal illusion that all round you are remains of those once glorious empires.<p>
The outcome is devastating for a young man and it took me years to stop looking inward and accept the validity of what have long happend in the outside world.
